<h3>This is a collection of projects I made in Python between the fall of 2022 and the fall of 2023.</h3>

These projects weren't originally planned to be shared and are in various stages of completion, so keep in mind they may still have bugs and commented-out code.

<h5>Projects:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Curve - BÃ©zier curve generator, use keys 1-4 to place points at the mouse curser, space to generate and r for random. </li>
  <li>Graphing - Creates parabolas and gets details about them based off of a vertex form parabola inputted by the user.</li>
  <li>Grid Engine - Test grid-based engine in which the user can set the value of tiles using the number keys. Please note this requires a image named test.png to be in the same folder as the python file in order to work correctly.</li>
  <li>Wave Collapse - Basic wave function collapse algorithm using recursion built on top of my Grid Engine. </li>
  <li>3D - My first attempt at doing 3D in python myself. I used lists as I did not know about classes at the time. Roughly following 
Radian628's 3D engine in Desmos videoas a guide: <a href="https://youtu.be/qTSEbSwhUfY">https://youtu.be/qTSEbSwhUfY</a>. Please note my triangle fill algorithm currently does not work. </li>
  <li>Game - Small 2D game in Pygame with basic physics and collision detection. </li>
  <li>Voronoi - A small Voronoi diagram generator I created to learn classes. </li>
  <li>Between Points - A small test of the algorithm I would later use in my ray marching project. </li>
  <li>Ray - A 3D ray marcher in Pygame that would later become the base of my 3D marcher in MakeCode Arcade. Please note that the specular lighting currently does not work and has been commented out.</li>
</ul>
